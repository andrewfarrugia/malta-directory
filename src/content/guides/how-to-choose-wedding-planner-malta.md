Malta weddings involve many moving parts. The right planner reduces risk by building a realistic timeline and coordinating suppliers early.

## Planner selection checklist

1. Confirm whether they offer full, partial, or day-of planning.
2. Review example timelines from similar event sizes.
3. Ask how they manage supplier delays.
4. Confirm communication cadence and response SLA.
5. Understand payment terms and refund policy.

Choose the planner whose process is clearest, not just the one with the longest vendor list.
