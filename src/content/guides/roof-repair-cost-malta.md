Roofing costs in Malta vary based on surface condition, membrane selection, and drainage complexity. Small patch repairs are lower cost, while full waterproofing systems require larger material and labor budgets.

## Typical roof work ranges

| Work item | Typical range |
| --- | --- |
| Leak inspection | EUR 40-120 |
| Localized patch repair | EUR 120-450 |
| Waterproof membrane refresh | EUR 1,000-4,000+ |
| Terrace re-sealing and detailing | EUR 800-2,500 |

Weather windows and prep work strongly affect project timelines. Always request written detail on substrate preparation, curing time, and warranty coverage.
