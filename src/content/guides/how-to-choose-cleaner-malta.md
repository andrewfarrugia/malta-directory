A reliable cleaning service is defined by repeatable outcomes, not just one strong first visit.

## Checklist before booking

1. Ask for a standard checklist template.
2. Confirm who supplies products and equipment.
3. Verify replacement policy if staff availability changes.
4. Confirm cancellation and rescheduling terms.
5. Request a trial session with clear goals.

Use documented checklists and feedback loops to keep quality high over time.
