Electric work affects safety and long-term reliability. This checklist helps you shortlist electricians with confidence.

## What to verify

- Job scope clarity and exclusions.
- Compliance and testing process.
- Project timeline with milestones.
- Material quality options.
- After-completion support window.

When comparing providers, prioritize clarity over speed. A detailed quote is usually a stronger predictor of quality than a fast one-line estimate.
