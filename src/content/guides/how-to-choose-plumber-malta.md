Choosing a plumber in Malta is easier when you compare the right details before booking.

## 10-point selection checklist

1. Confirm response time in your locality.
2. Ask for a written estimate with VAT clarity.
3. Check if emergency rates differ by time slot.
4. Ask what warranty is included.
5. Confirm parts quality and brand options.
6. Request a clear scope before work starts.
7. Ask how follow-up visits are billed.
8. Review recent customer feedback quality, not just star count.
9. Check communication speed before booking.
10. Keep all quotes and invoices in writing.

A provider that answers these quickly is usually easier to work with during urgent repairs.
