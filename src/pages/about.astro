      <h1>About Malta Service Hub</h1>
      <p>
        Malta Service Hub is a local-first directory and editorial platform built to help users compare service providers with more confidence. We focus on transparent structure, practical checklists, and useful locality context.
      </p>
      <h2>How we curate</h2>
      <p>
        We collect publicly available provider information, map services to categories and localities, and record source notes. Combined category-location pages are published only when they meet quality thresholds for utility.
      </p>
      <h2>Editorial principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Practical guidance over generic keyword copy.</li>
        <li>Clear internal linking for discovery and context.</li>
        <li>Ongoing updates to improve accuracy and depth.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </main>
